A talk about Go. It gives an overview of the basics and tooling, dives into OO and some other interesting bits and pieces of the languages, deals with concurrency and offers up some thoughts about the language itself. The talk is accompanied by a set of
working examples, and the concepts are illustrated in two example applications.
